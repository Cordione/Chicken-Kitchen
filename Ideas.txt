Create parsers for csv files: 

- For customer alergies:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.
- For food:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.
- For base ingredients:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.

Create index.ts which will have information from parsed files, (as arrays)

Basic algo will be:

Make function taking 2 parameters, name of customer, name of food
Create 3 arrays based on parsed files (customer/food/ingerdients).
[{customerName: "Bernard Unfortunate", "alergies: "Potatoes"}, {customerName: Adam Smith, alergies: ""}], [{name: "Fries", ingredients: "Potatoes"}], [{name: "Potatoes"}]
Find if customer name exist in passed array.
If exist go to next step. "Adam Smith", {customerName: Adam Smith, alergies: ""}] -> name matched, go next
If not exist Terminate. "John Doe", {customerName: Adam Smith, alergies: ""}] -> not matching, terminate.
Next create an empty array and find food in food array
Compare ingredients of food with base ingredients
IF food ingerdient exist in base ingredient array push it's name to new Array [{name: "Fries", ingredients: "Potatoes"}],  [{name: "Potatoes"}] -> ["Potatoes"]
IF not find ingerdients of this food and compare them with base ingredient <rinse and repeat if needed> [{ name: 'Princess Chicken', ingerdients:['Chicken','Youth Sauce' ]}, [{name: 'Chicken'}, {name: 'Asparagus'}, {name: 'Milk'}, {name: 'Honey'},], [] -> [{ name: 'Youth Sauce', ingerdients: [ 'Asparagus', 'Milk', 'Honey'] }], ['Chicken'] -> ['Chicken','Asparagus', 'Milk', 'Honey']
Next
IF newArray(with base ingredients of food contains alergic food of customer): "Bernard Unfortunate, Fries"-> [{customerName: "Bernard Unfortunate", "alergies: "Potatoes"}], [{name: "Fries", ingredients: "Potatoes"}],  [{name: "Potatoes"}] -> ["Potatoes"] -> baseIngredients.includes("alergies") -> "Bernard Unfortunate, Fries: Can't order, alergic to: Potatoes"
IF newArray not contains alergens return Example of success: "Adam Smith, Fries"-> [{customerName: "Adam Smith", "alergies: "Potatoes"}], [{name: "Fries", ingredients: "Potatoes"}],  [{name: "Potatoes"}] -> ["Potatoes"] -> baseIngredients.includes("alergies") -> "Adam Smith, Fries: success"
