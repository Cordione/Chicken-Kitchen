Create parsers for csv files: 

- For customer alergies:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.
- For food:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.
- For base ingredients:
    Create basic test which will confirm that csv is parsed properly.

Create index.ts which will have information from parsed files, (as arrays)

Basic algo will be:

Make function taking 2 parameters, name of customer, name of food
Create 3 arrays based on parsed files (customer/food/ingerdients).
Find if customer name exist in passed array.
If exist go to next step.
If not exist Terminate.
Next create an empty array and find food in food array
Compare ingredients of food with base ingredients 
IF food ingerdient exist in base ingredient array push it's name to new Array
IF not find ingerdients of this food and compare them with base ingredient <rinse and repeat if needed>
Next 
IF newArray(with base ingredients of food contains alergic food of customer) return Example of failure: “Elon Carousel - Fish in Water: can’t order, allergic to: Chocolate”
IF newArray not contains alergens return Example of success: “Julie Mirage – Fish in Water: success”
